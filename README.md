# Symbol Dapp Community

A GitHub Based Community to talk about Symbol Dapp Framework and its applications.

The main point to talk and share with other community members is at https://github.com/symbol-dapp/community/discussions.

There, we talk mainly about:

- [General](https://github.com/symbol-dapp/community/discussions/categories/general)

Anything that doesn't fit in other categories :smile:

- [Dapp Ideas](https://github.com/symbol-dapp/community/discussions/categories/dapps-ideas)

Crazy Dapp ideas. People share them and find other community members willing to collaborate on making that project a reality.

- [Framework Ideas](https://github.com/symbol-dapp/community/discussions/categories/framework-ideas)

Missing features that the framework has. It might be support for React, a module for better testing, a way to create re-usable libraries on top... anything that can help on a better developer experience. Here it comes!

- [Show and Tell](https://github.com/symbol-dapp/community/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)

People already building stuff... looking for feedback and users? Here is the place to share!
